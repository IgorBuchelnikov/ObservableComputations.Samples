# ObservableComputations.Samples

This solution allows you
1. Learn [ObservableComputations](https://github.com/IgorBuchelnikov/ObservableComputations) with simple samples.
2. Compare [ObservableComputations](https://github.com/IgorBuchelnikov/ObservableComputations) and [DynamicData](https://github.com/reactiveui/DynamicData) in action.

This solution is a modified version of [DynamicData.Samplz](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData.Samplz). The modification consisted of replacing [DynamicData](https://github.com/reactiveui/DynamicData) by [ObservableComputations](https://github.com/IgorBuchelnikov/ObservableComputations). Root of this repository is the version of [DynamicData.Samplz](https://github.com/RolandPheasant/DynamicData.Samplz), which was the basis for the modification. Modified version is placed in *./ObservableComputations.Samples* directory.

## About comparision [ObservableComputations](https://github.com/IgorBuchelnikov/ObservableComputations) and [DynamicData](https://github.com/reactiveui/DynamicData) 

The programming models [ObservableComputations](https://github.com/IgorBuchelnikov/ObservableComputations) and [DynamicData](https://github.com/reactiveui/DynamicData) have similar and different features. See details [here](https://github.com/IgorBuchelnikov/ObservableComputations#analogs). Therefore, the comparison is fraught with difficulties. In various samples, these difficulties are expressed to varying degrees. To a greater extent, these difficulties are expressed in "Filter An Observable" sample from [DynamicData](https://github.com/reactiveui/DynamicData) ("Add and remove items" sample from [ObservableComputations](https://github.com/IgorBuchelnikov/ObservableComputations)). But from the point of view of the end user, there are no differences in all the samples.
